# Custom Schema Parser

A simple parser for a custom schema language, written in Go. This project is inspired by a request from a user, and the code has been generated by the OpenAI's ChatGPT language model.

The legend wrote the code which was almost 90% working, and wrote this readme. üëè

## Overview

The custom schema parser can parse schema definitions in the following format:

```
type User('users') {
    id: ID!
    name: string
    username: string
    someInt: int
    someFloat: float
    someBool: bool
    someDate: date
    someDateTime: datetime
    ids: array<int>
}
```


The parser is divided into three main components:

1. `main.go`: Contains the `main()` function and data structures to represent the schema.
2. `lexer.go`: Tokenizes the input string into a series of tokens.
3. `parser.go`: Parses the tokenized input into schema structures.

## Usage

1. Build the parser:

```bash
$ go build -o parser
```
